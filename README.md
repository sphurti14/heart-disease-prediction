# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts the presence of heart disease using patient health data and Machine Learning techniques.

## Problem Statement
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early prediction can help in timely diagnosis and treatment.

## Dataset
The dataset contains patient health attributes such as age, cholesterol level, resting blood pressure, heart rate, and other medical indicators.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Logistic Regression
- Jupyter Notebook
- VS Code

## Project Workflow
1. Data loading and understanding
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Data cleaning and preprocessing
4. Encoding categorical variables
5. Feature scaling
6. Model training using Logistic Regression
7. Model evaluation (accuracy, classification report, confusion matrix)
8. Saving trained model

## Results
- Achieved approximately **79% accuracy** on test data
- Evaluated model using precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix

## Note
AI tools were used for understanding concepts, debugging, and improving code clarity.
The project implementation and learning are my own.
